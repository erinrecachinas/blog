For those of you who don't know - we celebrated our wedding in March.  Our day was perfect and filled with love and surrounded by joy. I was encouraged by many people to write down all the special touches that were included in our day.

To begin, I planned the whole thing with a little delegation to my mom and husband.  Everything from developing the menu with the caterer, picking out the flowers, to doing all the placecards I did - which is a completely separate post.

The things that made our day truly special started pretty early.  The first thing that happened was when my good friend and bridesmaid brought me a gorgeous charm for my bouquet featuring photos of my dad and me on one side and my grandmother on the other side.  This added such sentimental value to my walk down the aisle having those two extremely special people with me the whole time, just like they would want to be.  I have it on my mantle now in a gorgeous display viewer that is like a little snow globe for the charm (thanks mom).  When she was here, I took bridal portraits (in secret from mom).  Bridal portraits are a southern tradition that come from a time when weddings were not photographed, so this was a way to preserve the look of the bride and displayed at the reception.  I picked up flowers from my florist in Charlottesville, and we did my hair and makeup like it would be on the day of.  The photos turned out phenomenally (duh - my photographer was awesome).  I rush ordered a canvas of me to display at the reception and surprised my mom with it when she arrived for the weekend.  I had told her I wouldn't be able to get the photos done so she was so excited to have that special touch included in my day.

Another thing my mom did for me the day before the wedding.  I woke up to a little box by my bed with a set of prints from artifact uprising of me and my family through the years, and a box.  The box had a photo of my mom taken when she first found out she was pregnant with me with a note written on the back about how special that day was to her and how she still remembers it.  She also had texted me in the middle of the night a link to a spotify playlist that she curated for me of songs we grew up listening to and our current favorites. The last touch was a little purse for the wedding day with a little charm that had two clocks on it (since we are moving overseas in a couple weeks, one for her timezone, one for mine). It was truly so special to have that little "intro" to the wedding weekend with that goodie box from mom.
