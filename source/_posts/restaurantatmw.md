On our honeymoon, we went to Napa for an ultimate foodie week.  We hit up michelin after michelin starred restaurants: The French Laundry, Saison, and Meadowood. The meal at Meadowood began and both Mike and I knew that this was going to be a remarkable experience.  It blew the other restaurants out of the water.  Course after course the chef, staff, and ambiance were spectacularly paired to create an elevated culinary adventure that I will never forget.

We arrived after a mostly chaotic drive through Northern Napa. Our silvercar tire pressure was alarmingly low and Mike was teetering between being late to our reservation and living on the edge of low tire pressure (me being the one that let my tire pressure light stay on for almost 3 months because I talked myself into thinking that the physics of the air in the cold was just going to refill my pressure once it warmed up again). We chanced it and drove through the most stunning woods in St. Helena into the Resort at Meadowood.  It is a hidden gem among the droves of wineries and restaurants in Napa Valley, tucked away in the forrest that looks like a charming farm house.  The valet reassured us he would tend to the tire so we could enjoy our dinner, which seemed to make Mike feel better.

The inside of this restuarant was warm.  Fireplaces, wood, dim lighting but an energetic atmosphere.  The tables were made of thick, rough, marbly wood. The place settings were unique stones with different carved shapes in them (mine had a star, Mike's was boring and plain).  Our host came up to us with a hand written note from the chef welcoming us on our honeymoon and thanking us for dining with them on such a special occasion. The room was full of couples and groups happily chatting away like in a neighborhood hot spot, yet it had this air that made me not want to put my elbows on the table (which just doesn't happen. My elbows are ALWAYS ON THE TABLE).
