### I'm Erin. 

**TLDR of me:**

1. I am a lover of Christ and my desire is to serve and love others in any way I can. 

2. My passion is my family. My baes (Mike, my husband, and Ellie, my dog).

3. I am a foodie. There is just nothing I love more than food. Cooking, baking, and especially eating are my 3 favorite activities. I am known to plan vacations based on wanting to eat certain places.

4. I am a software engineer. I love what I do and can't imagine doing anything else.
